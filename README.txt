This module puts the site-wide contact form in a block so it can be easily put in a sidebar. 

TODO
-----
- Right now this module is hard-coded to remove the "contact information" entered by the user on /admin/build/contact/settings. It would be better to make this configurable from the admin/build/block page.
- This is hardcoded with a width of 40 characters. This should also be made configurable from admin/build/block.
